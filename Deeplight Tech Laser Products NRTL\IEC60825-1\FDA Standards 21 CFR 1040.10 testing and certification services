In the sales process of laser products, whether it is normal offline sales or online sales, safety issues will be involved. Most testing of laser safety issues is defined by IEC standards. IEC 60825-1:2014 is laser products safety testing standard, Part 1 is Equipment classification and requirements.


The Deeplight Tech can not only complete the IEC 60825-1:2014 standard test of laser products, but also complete the FDA standard 21 CFR 1040.10 testing, until obtaining FDA completed email and FDA listing for customers.
 In the same way, laser products are sold in the U.S. market, and Deeplight Tech can also help customers complete NRTL certification of laser products ,one-stop completion.



The NRTL\IEC60825-1\FDA Standard 21 CFR 1040.10 laser products testing content briefly introduced:

1.CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLES

(1)Radiation of a single wavelength, Wavelength : λ: 532nm.

(2)Radiation of multiple wavelengths, Laser product emits at two or more wavelengths.

(3)Radiation from extended sources testing.
(4)Non-uniform,non-circular or multiple apparent source testing.

(5)Laser products designed to function as conventional lamps.

(6)Normal condition at 532nm for retinal thermal hazard testing.

(7)Determination of the class of the laser product

(8)Angle of acceptance testing. (for each condition)

(9)Aperture diameters testing. (for each condition)

The above is an introduction testing of laser products. For more test cases, please contact Deeplight Tech for NRTL\ IEC 60825-1:2014\FDA Standards 21 CFR 1040.10 laser products testing and certification services.
